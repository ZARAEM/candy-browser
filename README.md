## Why Candy?

- **Made for gestures.** Switch tabs from the address bar, swipe into the visual overview, and
  dismiss cards with spring motion and haptic feedback.
- **Private by design.** Filtering, history, favorites, profiles, and privacy telemetry stay local.
- **Feels at home on Android.** Dynamic color, edge-to-edge content, Predictive Back, Autofill,
  passkeys, downloads, sharing, printing, and default-browser integration.

## Features

### Browsing and gestures

- Floating bottom chrome over edge-to-edge WebView content
- Pull to refresh, direct URL navigation, QR scanning, local domain completion, and optional
  provider-backed search suggestions (disabled in private tabs)
- Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, Brave, Ecosia, Startpage, and Qwant search
- Address commands with `>` for tab, profile, cache, cookie, and navigation actions
- Background tabs, downloads, sharing, printing, external apps, and assistant summaries

</p>

### Tabs, profiles, and journeys

- Persistent tabs with saved page previews, favicons, pinning, reordering, and automatic cleanup
- Cover flow, compact grid, and preview-free list layouts
- Optional per-profile WebView storage isolation where the installed provider supports it
- Private tabs that keep their session and journey data in memory only
- **Candy Trails:** persistent branching navigation graphs with pan, zoom, direct navigation,
  and forkable paths
- **Site Capsules:** profile-bound home-screen shortcuts with configurable navigation boundaries
  and minimal browser chrome

### Local protection

- EasyList/EasyPrivacy hosts plus a pinned, safely representable uAssets subset
- Third-party-cookie blocking and cosmetic cookie-banner hiding
- **Privacy X-Ray:** live per-tab block counts, categories, domains, and exceptions
- **Filter Studio:** global or profile rules, import/export, and confirmed HTTPS subscriptions
- Safe Browsing, TLS failure handling, blocked unsafe schemes, and external-scheme allowlisting

## Download

Candy Browser requires Android 14 (API 34) or newer.

[Download Candy Browser](https://github.com/sk2andy/candy-browser/releases)

Production builds check GitHub for updates at startup and offer the signed APK for download. Android
still requires you to open the downloaded file and approve installation.

## Build from source

Requirements: Android SDK 35 and JDK 17. Point `JAVA_HOME` to your JDK 17 installation.

```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest lintDebug assembleDebug
```

Debug APK: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`. It installs as
`dev.sk2andy.materialbrowser.debug`, uses the label `Candy Browser Debug`, and has a badged launcher
icon, so it can stay installed beside the release app.

### Signed release builds

Release builds are minified with R8 and require a signing key. Never commit a keystore or its
credentials. Configure signing locally with either an ignored project file or environment variables.

For the first release only, create a long-lived key if no release key exists yet. Reuse that same key
for every later release:

```bash
mkdir -p .signing
keytool -genkeypair \
  -keystore .signing/candy-release.keystore \
  -storetype PKCS12 \
  -alias candy \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 4096 \
  -validity 10000
```

For an ignored project file:

```bash
cp keystore.properties.example keystore.properties
# Replace every placeholder in keystore.properties, then:
./gradlew assembleLocalRelease
```

Alternatively, export the same values from `~/.zshrc.shared`:

```bash
export CANDY_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PATH=/absolute/path/to/project/.signing/candy-release.keystore
export CANDY_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD='replace-me'
export CANDY_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS='candy'
export CANDY_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD='replace-me'
```

Signed local APK: `app/build/outputs/apk/localRelease/app-localRelease.apk`

`localRelease` installs beside the GitHub build as `dev.sk2andy.materialbrowser.local` and uses a
separate launcher icon and the label `Candy Browser Local`. GitHub update prompts are disabled for
this side-by-side build because production APKs cannot update its package. The GitHub workflow
continues to use `assembleRelease`, preserving the production application ID and icon.

### GitHub releases

The manual `Release Android APK` workflow tests the selected source revision, builds and verifies a
signed APK, creates a `v<version>` source tag, and publishes the APK plus its SHA-256 checksum. Add
four repository secrets once:

```bash
base64 < "$CANDY_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PATH" | gh secret set CANDY_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64
printf '%s' "$CANDY_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD" | gh secret set CANDY_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
printf '%s' "$CANDY_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS" | gh secret set CANDY_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
printf '%s' "$CANDY_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD" | gh secret set CANDY_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
```

Pin the public certificate fingerprint separately. This prevents an accidentally replaced keystore
from publishing an APK that installed copies cannot update to:

```bash
keytool -exportcert \
  -keystore "$CANDY_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PATH" \
  -storepass:env CANDY_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD \
  -alias "$CANDY_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS" \
  | shasum -a 256 \
  | awk '{print $1}' \
  | gh variable set CANDY_RELEASE_CERTIFICATE_SHA256
```

The workflow uses the `release` GitHub environment. Configure required reviewers for that environment
if releases should require a manual approval after dispatch.

Then dispatch a release from GitHub Actions or with GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml \
  -f version=0.2 \
  -f prerelease=false
```

Android `versionCode` is the monotonically increasing GitHub workflow run number plus the current
source-code base of `1`, so the first automated release starts at `2`. Tags and releases are created
only after tests, release build checks, APK signing, certificate pinning, and signature verification
succeed. Back up the original keystore and credentials securely: Android updates must always use the
same signing key.

## Privacy and limitations

Candy uses Android System WebView as its only browser engine and renderer. It does not bundle a
Chromium fork, extension runtime, proxy, VPN, or second rendering engine. Filtering stays inside
each WebView through local request interception, document-start CSS/DOM rules, and service-worker
interception. WebSockets,
CNAME cloaking, some redirects, and content inside closed cross-origin or Shadow DOM contexts may
get through.

Privacy X-Ray includes only blocked requests that WebView can reliably attribute to one tab.
Service-worker requests are filtered but excluded from per-tab telemetry when no reliable tab ID
is available.

<details>
<summary><strong>Candy Rules and filter-source details</strong></summary>

Candy Rules v1 supports exact host block/allow rules, positive site-to-host pairs, HOSTS entries,
and origin-scoped standard CSS selectors. It deliberately rejects JavaScript, regular expressions,
redirects, response-header filters, scriptlets, and advanced cosmetic operators rather than
approximating them.

Bundled defaults may additionally use audited, declarative WebView rules: a site-scoped literal
request-path prefix or a known Reject/Remind-later consent control. These rules cannot run imported
JavaScript, never click Accept, and never intercept a main-frame navigation. An exact bundled path
rule may override the general same-party escape only for its audited page-host, request-host, and
literal non-root path prefix.

Imports are bounded and validated atomically. HTTPS subscriptions update only after a user-requested
fetch, show a diff, and require confirmation. Private-profile imports remain in memory.

EasyList, EasyPrivacy, and EasyList Cookie data are distributed under CC BY-SA 3.0 or later. The
uAssets-derived network subset is generated from a pinned revision of the official uBlock Origin Ads
source and distributed under GPL-3.0. Exact sources, revisions, transformations, and notices ship in
`app/src/main/assets/`.
